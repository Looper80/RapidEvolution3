Un-assimilated RE3 thoughts:

Recent:
tag values aren't normalized?
TOFIX: discogs
detection managers not working? (have to manually detect BI?)
detect all doesn't spawn task but rather individual ones?
consistency check should scrub mined bits
problem picking default thumbnail that's readable?!?
** tag "drum and bass" disappeared from tags view but still exists...
how are artists being added with 0 songs?

RE3:
  adding mixouts strangeness!!!!
  tag reading not working?
  flac initial key
  multiple detection tasks
  osx media player can't be closed
  prevent repeats option in main view
  opton to filter compatible/similar tab from style selections on left?
  clearing bpm/tags not instant
  billboard api
REPLAYGAIN_TRACK_GAIN caps
max simultaenous detection tasks
MIXOUTS PROBLEM
CTRL-A, SHIFT SELECT TAGS
when date added already exists
can't alt click multiple
write INITIAL KEY
file menu (with quit)
merge -> update counts
deleting songs from playlists, #s should have decreased
right click add tags should eventually update the count...
import/export excel files
check background priorities
investigate loss in hierarchy by studying downtempo style
when videi finished in full screen hung
making empty date added playlists
RE3:
	strict key search mode?
	tag writing behavior (to start immediately)
	set key/bpm in fields->set
	more testing with the mixout behavior (with them showing up and ratings)
	xuggle/quicktime crashes
	installer remember options

FORUM SHIT:

Some tag fields are removed from my files when I save the tag. I can reproduce this for File Owner (ID3v2.4: TOWN) and Original Filename (ID3v2.4: TOFN); maybe more fields are concerned. I'm using JAudiotagger and ID3v2.4 
It seems that the BPM formatting options (scaling, number of decimal places) have been removed. I used to store the BPM value as a 5 digit number, interpreted as 3 digits for the main part and 2 digits for the fractional part. This way I have standard tags and acceptable precision. This is not possible with RE3.


DESKTOP ACCESS:
 * rating ability on media player
 * ability to pause/resume video
use levinstein when saying "i alredy have", and for searching for duplicate tags/styles

need a semaphore around     	for (MinedProfile minedProfile : minedProfiles.keySet()) { in SearchProfile

tag integrity getting messed up (chill out was deleted and re-added2?)_
pause when sorting by tags, should not interrupt user?

dojo iframe to make cross domain calls to send tracking/click pixels

cancelling tasks that are put to sleep stay cancelled currently...
computing filter stats eating up cpu??
tags add-to doesn't work for ordered playlists (also--can't drag and drop to ordered playZASlist)
mobile -- fix show more results link

SEARCH BY LYRICS for karaoke
GUESS ARTIST NAME WHEN ONLY TITLE FOR KARAOKE?
selecting and dragging multiple tags is slow
SEARCH MATCH NOT CLEARED AFTER CLEARING TEXT


move sub-styles then click no and they go away temporarily"

#1 expanded profile section, bpm slider marks were off
#2 fix ordering of playlists to allow repeatss1.

TEST: date added empty  on new artst

in install shortcut, cvhange to java -jar to not rely on file extension for jar
database cleaner task causing styles to lose hierarchy again??

make sure discogs styles get to releases
limit # of writesr for some RWSemaphores?
counts for playlists # songs.. etc

have foreground tasks run in addition to background fore read tags task, etc, so it starts immediately ..
xx of xx results in lazy mode, when scrolled to bottom add more results
organize task hangs, worked after restart, lock within program? check FileLock...
determine why database cleaner remerges the same things
test cases for event fetchers...
2 lastfm artist fetch tasks started on same artists, due to on emand tasks -> make sure only 1 of each type goes at a time?

if you close the media player before it finishes loading, it will play audio but the media player is nowhere to be seen

volume changes to media player?!? (bad speakers?)
** add similarity tab to main screen, relative to current profile (could mean similarity of songs to artists?)
add key lock/etc/ to main view too
** add option
track sorting behavior
import from excel

ISSUES:
if the profile is switched, close add tags window?
crash when closing video player
dubstep bpm fix?
perf with tags--cached filter #s, handle better

NICE+EASY:
fBPM traktor reading decimals
able to edit more fields in-line in places...
places that toCustomCase is needed:
	when updating fields like artist name

NICE-DIFFICULT
acid format for ableton
lib on different drives to handle changing drive letters

NICE-OBSCURE:
remove from... option
ability to overwrite detect keys...
when setting artist name, if detected in title strip out

ffmpeg errors on i:\music\organized\p\plone\plock [1998]\plone - plock - [03] - sunday laid.wma

RE2:
	scrollbars on

## BUGS ##
##########

HIGH: 
 * get drag and drop to itunes working
 * difficulty editing artists, can't remove space in front of names, resorts.. (apply/cancel)
 * fix serato cue points being cleared
 * add to->play list "key me" kind of froze
 
MEDIUM:
 * window sizes/positions are slightly moving when reloaded? (test columns)
 * web access playlist # songs incorrect, is it just totaling up children?
 * investigate possible mem leaks (high ram breaks phonon player, try to keep it down)
 * changing volume can have startling results
 * rearranging columns can result in an empty one (not easily reproducible)
 * couldn't rename release title to lower case version (from songs->set fields, but could change by changing release title)
 * allow repeats of songs in ordered playlists
 * sorting of tags view doesn't seem consistent, loses expanded sections
 * don't show lyrics tab if "Not found"
 * playlist rating change did not show up

LOW:
 * when automerging with external items, list reset
 * when editing field in details, tabbing to next row does not continue "edit mode"
 * occasional error from qt: QTreeView::rowsInserted internal representation of the model has been corrupted, resetting.
 * phonon track time still messed (on some tracks)
 * quicktime popup of DRM content, needed to load itunes to authorize, waited for user input (any way to avoid?)

 * sometimes its not obvious why a song shows up (i.e. "love"-> minimal love so minimal showed up, although keyword "love" wasn't shown)
 * faad2 on linux
 * move encrypted string to a deep package structure for security
 * beat intensity failing on some files?
