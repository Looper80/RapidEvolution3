   <string>In the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkey

Butane in my veins and I&apos;m out to cut the junkie

With the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables

Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose




Kill the headlights and put it in neutral

Stock car flaming with a loser and the cruise control

Baby&apos;s in Reno with the vitamin D

Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love seat




Someone keeps saying, I&apos;m insane to complain

About a shotgun

 wedding and a stain on my shirt

Don&apos;t believe everything that you breathe

You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve




So shave your face with some mace... *** Your access is restricted to 30% of content. Please get permanent user ID key for 100% at lyricsfly.com/api/ ***
